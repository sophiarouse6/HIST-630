            <h2>"The German Society of New Orleans" </h2> 
            
            <p> We have already mentioned that the bill which was introduced at the last session
                of the Legislature, by , entitled  has become a law by the signature of <a href="https://www.sos.la.gov/HistoricalResources/AboutLouisiana/LouisianaGovernors1861-1877/Pages/HenryClayWarmoth.aspx"> Gov. Warmoth </a>. The bill appropriates the sum of $20,000 to the , in consideration of which this organization is to erect an immigrant depot at a
                cost of not less than $30,000. This and other provisions set forth in the bill are
                to be complied with before the State aid of $20,000 tan be claimed.</p>
            
            <p> We learn that steps have already been taken by the  looking toward the realization of the project facilitated by the opportune State
                aid and also tending toward inducing the Legislature to still farther promote the
                cause of immigration by placing the  financially in a condition which would extend the sphere of its usefulness. </p>
            
            <p> At a meeting of the <a href="https://deutscheshaus.org/das-deutsche-haus/">Board of Directors of the German Society </a>, a few days since, it was resolved that a committee com posed of the President, Vice
                President and secretary of the society be appointed, whose duty it shall be to select
                a suitable site for the proposed immigrant depot. Another resolution was adopted directing
                the President of the society to appoint a committee of three, whose duty it shall
                be to induce the Legislature to authorize the division of the present head tax upon
                immigrants arriving at our port equally between the  and the Charity Hospital</p>
            
            <p> Should the legislature acquiesce in this proposition, there appears to be no doubt
                that the pecuniary aid thus extended would be productive of good, by enabling tnegierman
                oociety, wniou, as our readers know, is an entirely benevo lent organization, to more
                efficiently pro mote immigration to our State. It would in course of time furthermore
                do away with that expensive and useless institution, the "Bureau of Emigration," which
                draws the money derived from the head tax on immigrants, with ont giving any equivalent
                for it.   </p>
